### Project Description
A web app where users upload a cloud photo, and the system finds the most resembling object, generates picture of it, shows before‚Äìafter images with a funny caption, and allows download.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Boredom strikes and people stare at clouds, wondering what they look like.
